# localdatetime
[github localdatetime](https://github.com/peitili/userscript/blob/master/github.com/localdatetime.user.js) userscript will display the absolute local datetime such as `Jul 16, 2019, 10:28 PM PDT` instead of `12 days ago`. This is specially useful when you want to compare this timestamp to other time such as deployment time, alert time in your system.
